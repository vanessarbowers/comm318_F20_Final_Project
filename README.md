## My final project for COMM318 _Stories from Data_ (Fall2020)

* This project examines data from the past 20 years of Oscars nominations and award winnners
* Research Question: Are the Oscars becoming more diverse over the years?

* One of the biggest calls for diversity is the #Oscarssowhite campaign that started in 2016. This was a call to the Oscars academy to take a closer look into why mostly white actors were nominated for the all the big award categories. Low percentages of minorities are nominated for the awards and even less win them. In 2020, there is also a call for diversity as well. Thus, I want to to explore this concept. Within my final project, I want to investigate how racially diverse Oscar award nominations have gotten in the last 20 years, and compare that to how the demographics of audience viewer-ship. Also, I want to possibly compare demographics across major American Award shows as well to see if this is a single issue or across all award shows.
