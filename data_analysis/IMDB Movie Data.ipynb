    "## Overall Observations\n",
    "* There are no stark differences from the scores from diverse movies and the ones in mostly white award winning movies. For example, Creed had a slightly better metascore rating than the 2 of winners of the acting awards/nominees.\n",
    "* Therefore, it shows that the quality of the film is pretty much on par, but why are there no diverse actors/actresses of color nominated for the awards?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations\n",
    "* Need to investigate further what (and who) determine these scores\n",
    "* Counterargument: One could possibly argue the acting was worse per say but it statistically there should be more actors and actresses of color at least nominated for the awards, if not winning.\n",
    "* There wasn't a lot of diverse critically acclaimed films in 2013 or 2014, thus it is harder to make comparisons, (why I only did one)\n",
    "* I chose the movies by looking up who won a major award for each year and selected one to showcase"
